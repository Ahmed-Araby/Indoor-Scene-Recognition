  1-down-sampled the images to a fixed resolution of 256 × 256.
  2- Given a rectangular image, we first rescaled the image such that the shorter side was of length 256, and then
     cropped out the central 256×256 patch from the resulting image.
  3- subtracting the mean activity over the training set from each pixel. 
     So we trained our network on the (centered) raw RGB values of the pixels
