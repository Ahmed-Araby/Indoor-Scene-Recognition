# preprocessing in imagenet paper:

  1-down-sampled the images to a fixed resolution of 256 × 256.  
  2- Given a rectangular image, we first rescaled the image such that the shorter side was 	of length 256, and then
     cropped out the central 256×256 patch from the resulting image.  [Done]

  3- subtracting the mean activity over the training set from each pixel. [Done]  (but theres is another approaches that we could try )
     So we trained our network on the (centered) raw RGB values of the pixels
     
	it's a per channel mean (local) calculated across the whole data set 


	then we could do normalization after it 
	or do normalization them do pixel centering 

 
keep the dtype to be float64 to keep hight precision for mean calculation  [done]
