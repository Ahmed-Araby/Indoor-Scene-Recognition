  1 - generating image translations  
  2 - horizontal reflections   [Done]
  [for 1 and 2]
  they do this by extracting random 227 × 227 patches (and their horizontal reflections)     	from the 256×256 images and training our network on these extracted patche

  3 -  [this is hard one that include PCA so I need to learn it ---- leave it for now ]
  
  test time :
  At test time, the network makes a prediction by extracting
  five 224 × 224 patches (the four corner patches and the center patch) as well as their horizontal
  reflections (hence ten patches in all), and averaging the predictions made by the network’s softmax
  layer on the ten patches.
